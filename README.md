# hair_salon
personal assessment week 3

READ ME! Hello fellow developer!

This read me will give you a better understanding of my hair style project and my sinatra website.

Setup

This Setup will only be for MACs because I dont know how to do it for Windows, Sorry PC users!

Specs: I am using Mac OSX yosemite 10.10.1 and the text editor Sublime text 2 along with the terminal using ruby 1.9.2 and Safari web browser

Create a folder called hair_salon and copy the folders and names of the files in my repository into it.

You now should have a hair_salon folder with three folders and two files (not including the README). Make sure Lib and spec have two files and views has 3 with all the right endings.

To begin you will need to open the terminal (make sure you are in the hair_salon folder) and download the gems: Sinatra Sinatra-contrib Sinatra/reloader bundler

then type bundle in your terminal. Now type $ ruby app.rb in your terminal.  This will open Sinatra and now you need to set up the database.

Now create a database in terminal called hair_salon with two tables: one named clippers and the other named patrons.  

Place in the clippers table a column for name as a varchar and for a id serial as a PRIMARY KEY.  Place in the patrons table clients

with clients as a varchar and list_id as an int.  You are all ready to go! Go back to Sinatra and have a grand old time making lists.

Next open your browser and type in local:4567 and the home page should come up. And thats it play with the project to your hearts content!
